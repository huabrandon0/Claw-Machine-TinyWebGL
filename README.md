# Claw Machine TinyWebGL
A claw machine game made using UCLA CS 174A's modified WebGL library "TinyWebGL-UCLA". This game was made for UCLA CS 174A (Fall 2017) Project 2.

To run this game on Windows, execute the launch_server.bat file.
The launch_server.bat file assumes Python and Google Chrome are installed and are accessible through the PATH environment variable.
The launch_server.bat file hosts the folder locally (on port 8000) so that the assets are accessible.
Then, it opens the game using Chrome.
